# Anime and Cartoon Watch Site on WordPress (personally created theme)

![Main page](https://i.imgur.com/qsX5H1h.png)

This site was created as a pet project. What can be done on it?

This is a site for watching anime and cartoons (although the admin can upload any video content here). The site contains a certain amount of content added by me. For example, on it, you can watch anime or cartoons and leave reviews about them (which will be stored on the site, and their average rating will be displayed on the page of a certain series). To leave reviews, the user must create an account.

The site has a convenient search, both by name and by category. The content pages themselves can be easily added from the admin panel. Most of the information is easily pulled using the TMDB API, but you can also enter it yourself.



## Features
- **Easy Navigation**: User-friendly interface for easily finding and watching your favorite anime and cartoon.
- **Categories and Tags**: Sort by genres and tags.
- **Ratings and Reviews**: Rate and leave reviews.
- **Search**: Integrated site search functionality.

## Search

**Search**: The search includes a field for entering a name at the top, after which all matches, if any, will be displayed to you. There are also panels on the left for selecting a genre, category, studio, or category (Full-length or TV series). There are also some other types of sorting.
